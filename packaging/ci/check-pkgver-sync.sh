# Guard the AUR-pkgver invariant: the version pinned in every committed PKGBUILD
# must name a release that ACTUALLY EXISTS, because each `source=` fetches the
# `v$pkgver` git tag / release assets. release.yml's post-release auto-bump
# pushes splitway-daemon/Cargo.toml to the NEXT (unreleased) version, so the
# daemon version is deliberately one ahead of the latest release at rest on
# master — the PKGBUILDs must therefore pin a real *released tag*, never the
# in-tree daemon version (the write side, sync-pkgver.sh, stamps the version
# being released). Fail the build on drift so `makepkg -si` from a checkout can
# never point at a tag / assets that do not exist.
#
# Needs the tags fetched (packaging.yml's meta job uses fetch-depth: 0).
